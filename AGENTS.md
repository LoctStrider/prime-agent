# AGENTS.md

Development rules for Prime Agent (Rust) on PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-agent, branch `main`.
Every contributor (human or agent) must read this before working on this repo.

## Repository

- **Never set git identity for commits to this repo's history.** Agents must not set
  `user.name`/`user.email` (config or `-c`) or `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME`/`GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL`/
  `GIT_COMMITTER_NAME`/`GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL` for commits that land in this repository.
  Those commits carry the identity of the ambient git config. If such a commit fails for a
  missing identity, report it instead of adding config. Allowed: the `*_DATE` variables
  (the golden corpus pins them for reproducibility), throwaway temp repos created by
  tests, and the release automation's bot identity.
- **Never add `Co-authored-by` trailers** — not in commit messages, not in squash
  suggestions, not as attribution for work merged from branches. A PR's commits carry
  one identity: the ambient git config's. Fabricated or hand-written trailers (including
  noreply forms) misattribute commits to unrelated GitHub accounts.
- The repo is PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-agent; the Rust implementation lives on the `main` branch.
- PRs go to the org repo with base `main`:
  `gh pr create --repo PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-agent --base main`.
- CI runs on the org's billing: `.github/workflows/continuous.yml` on `main` pushes and
  `release.yml` on version tags.
- The completed TypeScript implementation remains available at tag `v0.9.8` for
  historical reference, not as the correctness standard for current Rust behavior.

## Style and structure

- Workspace crates are prefixed `pa-`. The hard ownership rules: one owned area per crate,
  pa-types is the only shared crate, cycle-free dependency direction, minimal public APIs,
  no god-modules. The dependency direction is pinned in the Crates table below; each crate's
  README.md states its scope, non-goals, and public API surface.
- Prefer private modules with an explicitly exported public crate API. Internals are `pub(crate)`.
- Aim for files under 2,000 lines, tests included. The 2,000-2,100 range is a soft review
  signal, not a merge limit: when adding to an already-large file, consider splitting by
  responsibility rather than growing it further. Move related tests and docs with extracted code.
- Name modules for what they own, not `utils` or `common`. Follow existing structure: in
  `crates/pa-core/src/kernel/manager/`, `mod.rs` connects `execution.rs`, `requests.rs`, and
  `teardown.rs`; put a new kernel-manager concern beside them. In
  `crates/pa-core/src/cron/store/`, `mod.rs` connects `heartbeat.rs`, `jobs.rs`, and
  `session_artifacts.rs`; keep storage work there rather than growing the scheduler.
- Inline format args: always prefer `format!("{x}")` over positional.
- Collapse if statements per clippy::collapsible_if.
- Prefer method references over closures per clippy::redundant_closure_for_method_calls.
- Make `match` statements exhaustive; avoid wildcard arms.
- New traits need doc comments explaining their role and how implementations are expected to behave.
- No opaque positional `bool`/`Option` parameters (`foo(false)` is unreadable). Prefer enums,
  named methods, or newtypes. If you must pass an opaque literal by position, use an exact
  `/*param_name*/` comment matching the callee signature.
- Prefer native RPITIT trait methods with explicit `Send` bounds
  (`fn foo(&self) -> impl Future<Output = T> + Send;`) over `#[async_trait]` or
  `#[allow(async_fn_in_trait)]`. Implementations may use `async fn` when they satisfy the contract.
- No single-use helper methods. Do not create a helper referenced only once.
- Instrument async work at the definition (`#[tracing::instrument(...)]`), not with
  `.instrument(...)` at call sites. Check whether the callee is already instrumented first.

## Change hygiene

- One logical change per PR. Fixes ride with the change that introduced them when possible; a PR
  that mixes a feature with unrelated lint fixes or refactors hides both from review.
- If you change dependencies (`Cargo.toml`), regenerate/commit `Cargo.lock` in the same change.
  A new dependency is an architectural change: state in the PR why the existing crates cannot
  host the functionality, and `make deny` must stay clean for it.
- If a change starts forcing edits across many crate internals, stop and fix the boundary instead.
- Do not commit scripts or tools that no workflow, Makefile target, or other code runs (one-off review, parity, or reproduction scripts). Put their results in the PR body as a one-off run with its command and result, not as coverage.
- Do not commit evidence logs, reports, generated outputs, or local venvs and caches that no code or test reads.

## Tests

- Prefer whole-object equality comparisons over field-by-field checks.
- Do not add tests for statically defined values.
- Do not add negative tests for logic that was removed.
- Bug fixes need a regression test that fails without the fix.
- Keep test code in proportion to the change: one discriminating test per behavior change, not several that pin the same behavior or re-check behavior the PR does not change.
- A new test file must be run by something: a runner, glob, loop, or run-time path in `.github/workflows/` or the Makefile. A name missing from those files can still be reached by a glob or a built path, so check those before calling a test unrun.
- Verifiers over self-assessment: tmux user-level tests, Rust behavior tests, and golden
  corpora replayed against real captured data. No lane merges without its verifier
  passing, rerun by the reviewer where feasible.
- Tests must wait for observable readiness, not fixed sleeps or retry-to-green loops. If a
  test must be disabled, give a reason at the test. Use isolated ports and temporary paths, and
  restore shared state. Run focused tests when changing their behavior.

## Lint discipline

- Zero-warning posture: the merge gates run fmt + clippy + tests at `-D warnings`, so a `warn`
  lint is a merge blocker. Keep the enabled set deliberate and selective; enable a new lint family
  only with every current site fixed in the same change.
- Explain lint exceptions next to the `#[allow(...)]` or workspace configuration; keep
  exceptions narrow. Advisory ignores in `deny.toml` need a reason and review date.

## Performance and the critical path

The UI critical path is paint-latency-critical. First paint, and every
frame the user waits on, must never block on network, disk sync, or
background bookkeeping. The launch benchmarks measure this surface
(cold/warm ready, first paint); a merge that regresses them undoes the
product's core claim.

Rules:

- Nothing user-visible awaits the network. Any HTTP/socket call on a
  render path (catalog fetch, update check) runs on a background worker;
  the paint path hands the work off and returns immediately. Delivery
  semantics (timeout, retry, ordering) live with the worker, not the caller.


## Merge gates

- `cargo fmt --all --check`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`,
  `cargo test --workspace` must pass before every merge. Run `make check` — the local mirror of
  the same gates; CI runs on the org's billing (`.github/workflows/continuous.yml` on `main`
  pushes; `release.yml` on version tags). The PR-only codebase-health check reports growth
  past 2,000 lines as review guidance; it never blocks a merge.
- PRs that change shipped paths need a `.changes/<branch-slug>.md` fragment (one user-facing
  bullet; see `.changes/README.md`) or the `no-changelog` label; the changelog-fragment check enforces it.
- User-visible changes need evidence from current Rust behavior tests. Preserve supported
  historical session formats, cross-version locks, and promised wire compatibility; these
  contracts do not require matching the retired TypeScript release's output or command list.
- PRs must state ownership compliance (crate README scope/non-goals/public API, dependency
  direction) and classify the change: internals, new `pub` surface, or a new
  dependency/cross-crate re-export. The latter two are architectural changes — an innocent-looking
  `pub use` is a very simple way to break encapsulation.
- The compiled fallback model catalog and transport templates in
  `crates/pa-ai/src/models_generated.rs` are hand-maintained Rust (there is no generator).
  The catalog fixture `crates/pa-models/tests/fixtures/catalog.v1.json` refreshes with
  `scripts/generate-catalog-fixture.py`. Bulk data files are exempt from the size guidance.

## Branding

The product is Prime Agent - we are not a pi fork. Scrub "pi"/"pi-mono"/"pi-ai"/
"Prime Intellect"-style naming from all user-visible surfaces (docs, READMEs,
CLI help text, error messages, splash/onboarding strings, keybinding hints, TUI
labels, and code comments that quote user-facing strings); brand everything
Prime Agent. Audit with a repo-wide grep and classify every hit (user-visible
vs wire-internal vs comment) before scrubbing, and list the preserved wire
identifiers in the PR body so the reviewer can verify none were wrongly scrubbed.

EXPLICIT EXCEPTION: identifiers required by supported protocols and persisted formats (e.g. the PI_PACKAGE_DIR env var, settings keys, provider IDs like prime-inference, harness _meta namespaces like ai.primeintellect.prime-agent, lockfile names) stay unless deliberately migrated — compatibility beats branding on the wire.



## Surface contract (must not change)

- Tools exposed to the model: `bash`, `edit`, `python_repl` (internal helpers: `rename`, `stdout`).
- RLM kernel API in the persistent Python REPL: `rlm.spawn/find_models/collect/list_subagents/delete_subagent/create_session/progress_note`, `rlm.harness` CRUD, `agent_message.send`, `agent_observe`, `compact`, `goal`, `refine`, `attach_image`, skills (markdown + Python) per the skill contract in the base system prompt.
- System prompt structure: layered — cache-stable static layer files (core harness description with the full API surface, mandatory usage rules, opinionated guidelines, per-model additions from the model-prompts TOML rule map) followed by one dynamic tail (packages, project context, skills inventory, MCP servers, environment, session role); the harness digest stays a separate `[harness-digest]` user message. `prime-agent prompt` dumps the assembled prompt with its layer breakdown.
- CLI shape: `prime-agent` with the same commands/flags as the TS product; headless modes (RPC/daemon/session-worker) with identical behavior.

## Crates

One owned area per crate; `pa-types` is the only shared vocabulary crate.
Dependencies flow from the composition root toward lower crates, never back upward.
The table summarizes each crate's current direct workspace dependencies:

| Crate | Purpose | Direct workspace dependencies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pa-types` | Shared wire and domain types | none |
| `pa-agent` | Provider-independent agent loop | none |
| `pa-ai` | Providers, model registry, streaming | `pa-types` |
| `pa-models` | Live model catalog and transport | `pa-ai`, `pa-types` |
| `pa-core` | Session engine, tools, skills, kernel, settings | `pa-types`, `pa-ai`, `pa-models`, `pa-agent` |
| `pa-daemon` | Supervisor, workers, wire protocol | `pa-types`, `pa-core`, `pa-agent`, `pa-ai`, `pa-models` |
| `pa-tui` | Terminal UI, daemon-wire client | `pa-types` |
| `pa-cli` | `prime-agent` binary, composition root | `pa-types`, `pa-core`, `pa-ai`, `pa-agent`, `pa-daemon`, `pa-tui` |
| `pa-perf` | Performance corpora + pty bench harness (dev/CI tooling, never shipped) | `pa-types`, `pa-core`, `pa-daemon` |

Layering rules:

- Dependencies only point from higher crates to lower crates shown above. No cycles or
  reverse edges. The leaf crates are peers; add only the dependencies needed for their work.
  Shared wire/domain vocabulary belongs in `pa-types`, not in a higher crate or a duplicate.
- `pa-tui` renders from wire types and events; it does not link the session engine.
- `pa-cli` is a composition root: it wires crates together and contains no business logic.

## Reliability model

- The daemon is a supervisor: it spawns one worker process per active session instead of hosting sessions in-process. Workers are supervised, restarted with backoff, and sessions persist on disk (append-only JSONL, same layout as `~/.prime/agent/sessions`) so reattach works even if the supervisor restarts.
- No stubs, no `todo!()`, no swallowed errors (`anyhow` bubbling to UI is fine).

## References

- Cursor Bugbot's PR review rules (`.cursor/BUGBOT.md`) mirror the standards in this file - update both whenever either changes.
